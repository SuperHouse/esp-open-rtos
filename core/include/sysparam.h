 *  Read/write "system parameters" to persistent flash.
 *
 *  System parameters are stored as key/value pairs.  Keys are string values
 *  between 1 and 65535 characters long.  Values can be any data up to 65535
 *  bytes in length (but are most commonly also text strings). Up to 126 key/
 *  value pairs can be stored at a time.
 *
 *  Keys and values are stored in flash using a progressive list structure
 *  which allows space-efficient storage and minimizes flash erase cycles,
 *  improving write speed and increasing the lifespan of the flash memory.
