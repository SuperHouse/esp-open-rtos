/* Use the IRAM macro to place functions into Instruction RAM (IRAM)
   instead of flash (aka irom).

   (This is the opposite to the Espressif SDK, where functions default
   to being placed in IRAM but the ICACHE_FLASH_ATTR attribute will
   place them in flash.)

   Use the IRAM attribute for functions which are called when the
   flash may not be available (for example during NMI exceptions), or
   for functions which are called very frequently and need high
   performance.

   Usage example:

   void IRAM high_performance_function(void)
   {
       // do important thing here
   }

   Bear in mind IRAM is limited (32KB), compared to up to 1MB of flash.

/* Use the RAM macro to place constant data (rodata) into RAM (data
   RAM) instead of the default placement in flash. This is useful for

   Usage example:

   const RAM uint8_t constants[] = { 1, 2, 3, 7 };

   When placing string literals in RAM, they need to be declared with
   the type "const char[]" not "const char *"

   Usage example:

   const RAM char hello_world[] = "Hello World";

/* Use the IRAM_DATA macro to place data into Instruction RAM (IRAM)
   instead of the default of flash (for constant data) or data RAM
   (for non-constant data).

   This may be useful to free up data RAM. However all data read from
   any instruction space (either IRAM or Flash) must be 32-bit aligned
   word reads. Reading unaligned data stored with IRAM_DATA will be
   slower than reading data stored in RAM. You can't perform unaligned
   writes to IRAM.
*/
#define IRAM_DATA __attribute__((section(".iram1.data")))

/* Use the IROM macro to store constant values in IROM flash. In
  esp-open-rtos this is already the default location for most constant
  data (rodata), so you don't need this attribute in 99% of cases.

  The exceptions are to mark data in the core & freertos libraries,
  where the default for constant data storage is RAM.

  (Unlike the Espressif SDK you don't need to use an attribute like
  ICACHE_FLASH_ATTR for functions, they go into flash by default.)

  Important to note: IROM flash is accessed via 32-bit word aligned
  reads. esp-open-rtos does some magic to "fix" unaligned reads, but
  performance is reduced.
