 *
 * Functional Description of the BME680 sensor
 *
 * The BME680 sensor only support two modes, the sleep mode and the forced
 * mode in which measurements are done. After power-up sequence, the sensor
 * automatically starts in sleep mode. To start a measurement, the sensor has
 * to switch in the forced mode. In this mode it performs exactly one
 * measurement of temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas in that order,
 * the so-called TPHG measurement cycle. After the execution of this TPHG
 * measurement cycle, raw sensor data are available and the sensor returns
 * automatically back to sleep mode.
 *
 * Using the BME680 consists of the following steps
 *
 * 1. Trigger the sensor to switch into forced mode to perform one THPG cycle
 * 2. Wait until the THPG cycle has been finished (measurement duration)
 * 3. Fetch raw sensor data, compensate and convert them to sensor values
 *

/**
 * @brief	Initialize a BME680 sensor
 *
 * The function initializes the sensor device data structure, probes the
 * sensor, soft resets the sensor, and configures the sensor with the
 * the following default settings:
 *
 * - Oversampling rate for temperature, pressure, humidity is osr_1x
 * - Filter size for pressure and temperature is iir_size 3
 * - Heater profile 0 with 320 degree C and 150 ms duration
 *
 * The sensor can be connected either to an I2C or a SPI bus. In both cases,
 * the parameter *bus* specifies the ID of the corresponding bus. Please note
 * that in case of SPI, bus 1 has to be used since bus 0 is used for system
 * flash memory.
 *
 * If parameter *addr* is greater than 0, it defines a valid I2C slave address
 * and the sensor is connected to an I2C bus. In that case parameter *cs* is
 * ignored.
 *
 * If parameter *addr* is 0, the sensor is connected to a SPI bus. In that
 * case, parameter *cs* defines the GPIO used as CS signal
 *
 * @param   bus     I2C or SPI bus at which BME680 sensor is connected
 * @param   addr    I2C addr of the BME680 sensor, 0 for SPI
 * @param   cs      SPI CS GPIO, ignored for I2C

 * until the results are available. It strongly depends on which measurements
 * are performed in the THPG measurement cycle and what configuration
 * parameters were set. It can vary from 1 RTOS (10 ms) tick up to 4500 RTOS
 * ticks (4.5 seconds).
