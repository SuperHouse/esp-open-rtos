 * In the *single shot mode*, this function has to be called for each
 * measurement. The measurement duration has to be waited every time
 * before the results can be fetched.

 * the measurement duration has to be waited only once until the first
 * results are available. After this first measurement, the sensor then
 * automatically performs all subsequent measurements. The rate of periodic
 * measurements can be 10, 4, 2, 1 or 0.5 measurements per second (mps).
 * 
 * Please note: Due to inaccuracies in timing of the sensor, the user task
 * should fetch the results at a lower rate. The rate of the periodic
 * measurements is defined by the parameter *mode*.
