Note:  The file atca_iface.h is copied from cryptoauthlib/lib/atca_iface.h.  The difference is, the anonymous struct names have been commented out, since they are not valid in c++ (only c11).  Otherwise this file is exactly the same.  Its presence here overrides the
one in cryptoauthlib.  See <https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib/issues/43>.

Also see <https://github.com/Petezah/CryptoAuthLib-Tools> for some tools which aid in generating config data for the ECC module.
