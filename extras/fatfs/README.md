# FatFs - Generic FAT File System Module

Current version: R0.12b

## How to use

Connect your SD card to ESP module

 SD pin |  ESP8266 
--------|------------
1. DAT2 |  -
2. /CS  | Any accessible GPIO (15, 5, 4, 0, 2, 16)
3. DI   | HMOSI (GPIO13)
4. VDD  | +3V3
5. CLK  | HCLK (GPIO14)
6. VSS  | GND
7. DO   | HMISO (GPIO12)
8. RSV  | - 

Add `extras/sdio` and `extras/fatfs` to `EXTRA_COMPONENTS` parameter of your
makefile, e.g.

```Makefile
EXTRA_COMPONENTS = extras/sdio extras/fatfs
```

Use `const char *f_gpio_to_volume(uint8_t gpio)` to get the FatFs volume ID
based on GPIO which is used for CS pin.

## FatFs configuration

Almost all of the FatFs parameters are configurable in the Makefile of your
project. See default values and their meaning in `defaults.mk`.
