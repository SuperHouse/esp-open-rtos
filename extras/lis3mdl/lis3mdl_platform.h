/**
 * Driver for LIS3MDL 3-axes digital magnetometer to I2C or SPI.
 *
 * This driver is for the usage with the ESP8266 and FreeRTOS (esp-open-rtos)
 * [https://github.com/SuperHouse/esp-open-rtos]. It is also working with ESP32
 * and ESP-IDF [https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git] as well as Linux
 * based systems using a wrapper library for ESP8266 functions.
